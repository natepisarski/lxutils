# lxutils
10 years ago, I decided to contribute to Linux. I wanted to read as much documentation as possible, to see where I could have the best impact. To my surprise, the documentation in the Linux source tree itself is... actually sort of bad.

It's not very consistent in its formatting, and it very rarely uses `Markdown` despite that having been industry-standard for quite some time.

I decided that how I would help the situation is by creating tools to automatically convert **all** existing documentation in the Linux source tree to semi-readable Markdown.

The initiative never went anywhere (it was turned down by the Linux maintainers in IRC for being too large of a change, and just very hard), but these tools came from it.

It will turn a generic `README` into a somewhat-more-markdown-friendly `README.md`
